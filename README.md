## 📱 Just completed an exciting project on SMS spam message detection using machine learning during my internship at CodSoft. Here's a closer look at what I've been working on:

### 🔍 Project Overview:
During my internship, I focused on developing a machine learning model to detect spam messages in SMS data. The goal was to accurately classify messages as spam or not spam (ham) based on their content.

### 🛠️ Tools & Techniques Used:
For this project, I utilized a range of Python libraries including pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn. These tools were instrumental in performing data analysis, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

### 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
I started by exploring the dataset, visualizing message lengths, and analyzing label distributions. This step helped me gain insights into the nature of the data and understand the characteristics of spam and ham messages.

### 🤖 Building Machine Learning Models:
Using techniques such as TF-IDF vectorization, I transformed the text data into numerical features suitable for machine learning algorithms. I then built and trained models including Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) to classify messages.

### 📈 Model Evaluation and Results:
After training the models, I evaluated their performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The SVM model emerged as the most accurate, achieving an impressive accuracy of 98% in classifying messages as spam or ham.
